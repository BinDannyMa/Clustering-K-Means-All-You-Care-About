## Index for the Notebook Series on K-Means Clustering

There are 6 notebooks.

1. Clustering-1-K-Means -- Introduction to K-Means and Its Implementation using a sunthetic dataset
2. Clustering-2-K-Means -- How to choose optimal number of clusters?
3. Clustering-3-K-Means -- Optimization techniques for faster and optimal convergence

Finally, we will apply K-Means on three application scenarios. 

4. Clustering-3-K-Means-Application I - Image Segmentation 
5. Clustering-3-K-Means-Application II - Data Preprocessing (Dimensionality Reduction)
6. Clustering-3-K-Means-Application III - Semi-supervised Learning
